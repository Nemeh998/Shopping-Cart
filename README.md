#### Exam:
Create a new repository on your Github and name it 'my-garden'.

Build a one-page website using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript. The wire-frame of the targeted page is attached to Slack.

You will be building a simple webpage "My Fabulous Garden" which contains all of the flowers that you have.

- As a user, I would like to be able to add new flowers so I can track the flowers I have in my garden. 
    - Create a form in order to add the **flowers name** and **flower category** and **flower season**. 
    - The category should have a predefined list that contains the following categories: 
        - Alstroemerias
        - Gardenias
        - Orchids
        - Roses
        - Sunflowers
        - Tulips
        - Peonies

- As a user, I would like to view all of my Flowers that I already added so that I can quickly view my flowers in my garden. - Whenever you add a flower using the form, you should use the local storage in order to get all the flowers from it and render them using **DOM**.

- As a user, I would like to see along side the flower information, the flower name, season, and image. The flower images can be found in the folder directory img.

**Stretch Goals**
- As a user, I would like to delete any chosen flower so I can handle the flowers in my garden. - When you press on the 'X' button, the flower should be deleted from the rendered DOM and the local storage.

- As a user, I would like to have the option to clear the whole rendered DOM. There will be a button when clicked it will clear the local Storage and the rendered DOM.
